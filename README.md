# SemiSmart-Verify
#Extraction and Verification of Information from Semi-Categorized Data

**Objective:** The primary objective of this project is to streamline data extraction and validation processes from semi-structured and unstructured documents using advanced NLP techniques. By introducing interactive modules for HR and competitive exams, the system aims to automate critical tasks, such as matching resumes with job descriptions and verifying candidate eligibility for examinations. Furthermore, the project seeks to bridge gaps in traditional parsing systems, ensuring reliability, scalability, and adaptability for real-world applications.
Abstract: The rapid advancement in e-recruitment systems has revolutionized the hiring process, enabling efficient handling of vast volumes of resumes. However, the diversity in resume formats often disrupts data mining operations such as information extraction, profile matching, and applicant ranking. Traditional methods, including rule-based and supervised approaches, heavily rely on large annotated datasets, making them time-intensive and prone to inaccuracies. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a resume parsing framework integrated with two additional modules: HR Module and Competitive Exam Module. The framework uses text block classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) enhanced by ontology to ensure accurate extraction and verification of data. These modules automate the validation of form details and supporting documents, offering alerts for mismatches and facilitating seamless data storage for improved decision-making in recruitment and examination processes.

Existing System: Current systems for resume parsing and information extraction depend on rule-based, supervised, and semantic methods, which often require extensive annotated data. While these systems provide basic functionalities, they fail to address the challenges posed by inconsistent resume formats, leading to inefficiencies and inaccuracies in parsing operations.
**Disadvantages of Existing System:**
1.	Dependence on large annotated datasets, which are time-consuming and costly to prepare.
2.	Limited adaptability to diverse formats and unstructured data.
3.	Incomplete knowledge representation impacting the accuracy of parsed data.
4.	Lack of real-time validation and feedback mechanisms for errors in forms or documents.
**List of Algorithms:**
1.	Named Entity Recognition (NER)
2.	Text Block Classification
3.	Ontology-based Information Enrichment
4.	Rule-Based Matching Algorithms
5.	NLP-based Validation Techniques
Proposed System: The proposed system employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for robust data extraction and validation. It introduces two modules—the HR Module and Competitive Exam Module—that enhance user interaction and automate document verification. The HR Module matches resumes against job descriptions, while the Competitive Exam Module validates eligibility and exam forms. Both modules employ NER and ontology-based enrichment to ensure precise and reliable outcomes.
**Advantages of Proposed System:**
1.	Enhanced accuracy in extracting and verifying information from diverse document formats.
2.	Real-time alerts for mismatched or incomplete data, reducing manual errors.
3.	Streamlined integration with databases for efficient data storage and retrieval.
4.	Improved user experience with interactive modules for HR and competitive exams.
